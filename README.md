# SOS-France

## About
SOS France is an emergency numbers app for people located in France. It is designed with simplicity in mind. When a user needs to call emergency services the first tab has all the numbers needed that they can tap and call. The second tab has helpful emergency phrases in English and French. The phrases are searchable and tappable to show the selected on in a large card. The third tab is your location with precise address so the user knows where to tell the operater where they are.

## Tech Stack
Built in SwiftUI and UIKit with RevnueCat for paywall.
